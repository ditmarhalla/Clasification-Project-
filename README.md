# Clasification-Project

This is a python project intendet to be an introduction into classification and then on machine learning. This was part of a University subject but that I continued in order to gain more insight into python.
In this classification we have an array of data. Each array is composed by 7 numbers in the trained.txt dataset and by 6 numbers in the untrained.txt dataset. In the trained dataset we have 15 000 array and in the untrained one we have 3.4 million array. Using python we have to classify the untrained data using the trained data that we have.
